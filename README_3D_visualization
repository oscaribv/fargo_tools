# A small tutorial to visualize 3D disk with paraview
############################################################

This small tutorial explains how to visualize 3D disks using
paraview using the csv files created by trans_to_csv program,
but in general it can be used in all visualization program 
that admit csv files.

#Installing paraview

The paraview binary files can be downloaded from http://www.paraview.org/.
Some linux distributions, as fedora, admit to download it from its repositories.

installing paraview in fedora
	yum install praview

#Compiling trans_to_csv

Inside fargo_tools a directory called trans_to_csv exists. 
There are a Makefile, an input.dat sample and maybe 
some *.o files inside  this directory.
To compile you need to have installed the fortran and OPENMP 
libraries, if your computer have this packages, 
it must compiles when you type 
		make
inside trans_to_csv directory

#input.dat file

Before running trans_to_csv you need to feel correctly the 
input.dat file, next there is an example of a input.dat file

128	#Number of cells in the X direction
128	#Number of cells in the Y direction
128	#Number of cells in the Z direction
1	#Number of output files
-3.1416	#Min value in X direction 
3.1416	#Max value in X direction 
0.4	#Min value in Y direction 
2.5	#Max value in Y direction 
1.42	#Min value in Z direction 
1.72	#Max value in Z direction 
s	#s for spherical, c for cylindrical, r for cartesian
my_dir	#This is not used by the code 

#Getting csv files

Once you have compiled trans_to_csv and filled input.dat file
you are ready to get csv files.
copy both trans_to_csv and input.dat files into the directory
where the ouptput files are. This place must be inside 
	~/outputs/SETUP_OUTPUT
then you have to run the file inside this directory. It allows
parallel running, so you have to running it 
	mpirun -np N ./trans_to_csv
being N the number of processors you want use.
