This small tutorial explains how to visualize 3D disks using
paraview using the csv files created by trans_to_csv program,
but in general it can be used in all visualization program 
that admit csv files.

#Installing paraview

The paraview binary files can be downloaded from http://www.paraview.org/.
Some linux distributions, as fedora, admit to download it from its repositories.

installing paraview in fedora, type in your terminal
	$ sudo yum install paraview

This must be enough to install paraview in your computer.

#Compiling trans_to_csv

Inside fargo_tools a directory called trans_to_csv exists. 
There are a Makefile, an input.dat sample and maybe 
some *.o files inside  this directory.
To compile it, you need to have installed the FORTRAN90 and OPENMP 
libraries, if your computer have this packages the compilation must work.

it must compiles when you type 
	$ make

inside trans_to_csv directory, this generates an excutable file called trans_to_csv.

#input.dat file

Before running trans_to_csv you need to fill correctly a
input.dat file, there is an example of a input.dat file

128	#Number of cells in the X direction
128	#Number of cells in the Y direction
128	#Number of cells in the Z direction
0	#minimum output file to be transformed
1	#maximum output file to be transformed
1	#size of the jump between output files to be transformed
-3.1416	#Min value in X direction 
3.1416	#Max value in X direction 
0.4	#Min value in Y direction 
2.5	#Max value in Y direction 
1.42	#Min value in Z direction 
1.72	#Max value in Z direction 
s	#s for spherical, c for cylindrical, r for cartesian

#Getting csv files

Once you have compiled trans_to_csv and filled input.dat file
you are ready to get csv files.
copy both trans_to_csv and input.dat files into the directory
where the ouptput files are. This place must be inside 
	~/outputs/SETUP_OUTPUT
then you have to run the file inside this directory. It allows
parallel running, so you have to running it 
	mpirun -np N ./trans_to_csv
being N the number of processors you want use.
